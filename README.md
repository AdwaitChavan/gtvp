**Global Temperature vs Precipitation** is a Data Science project with the goal to learn Machine Learning & Data Science via Python. The project uses data on global temperature and precipitation collected from 85794 locations globally. This data was cleaned. Train-test split & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) were performed on the data. Utilized sklearn, numpy & pandas libraries. Multivariate Linear Regression model was implemented for prediction of annual temperature in this supervised learning. Stats Models API was used for OLS Regression Results in order to analyze & conclude relationship between the two entities.
