**Global Temperature vs Precipitation** is a Data Science project with the goal to learn Machine Learning & Data Science via Python. The project uses data on global temperature and precipitation collected from 85794 locations globally. Train-test split & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) were performed on the cleaned data. Utilized sklearn, numpy & pandas libraries. Multivariate Linear Regression model was implemented for prediction of annual temperature in this supervised learning. Stats Models API was used for OLS Regression Results in order to analyze & conclude relationship between the two entities.  

The features of the model are each of the months of January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December. The reason for choosing these features is because the trends in annual precipitation vary vastly with respect to monthly temperature depending on which month of the year it is. 
A small practical example of this could be that these days we experience more fluctuations in precipitation in some months, when all of the months have almost the same changes in temperature due to global warming.
